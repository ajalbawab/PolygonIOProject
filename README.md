# PolygonIOProject

The following files are ways to live stream equity information from Polygon.IO into a SQL database and also calculate indicators in real time.
One of the dependancies is sqlalchemy's pre-release beta. This includes native support for MariaDB.

Bring in the .sql file into your local MariaDB server.

The .env file should look like this:

DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_DB=
APIKey=


Then hit go!

Blessed
